The following snippets are available in this repo

<br />

### Table of Contents: Version 1

<p align="center"><img style="width: 100%;text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-table-of-contents/main/Snippets/TOC%20Version%201/images/example_1.gif"></p>

The `Table of Contents: Version 1` snippet displays a table of contents. It compiles a list of all your folder's current subpages and pulls the headers from each page to display in a simple and neat list.

<br />

For this version, you will need to create a new **Folder Note** using the [Folder Notes Plugin](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes), and then paste the provided code at the top of the new folder note.

<br />

This version requires you to install the following:
- [Dataview Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)
- [Folder Notes Plugin](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes)

The `Table of Contents: Version 2` snippet displays a table of contents. It compiles a list of all your folder's current subpages and pulls the headers from each page to display in a simple and neat list.

<br />

To use this snippet, paste the provided table of contents code at the top of a regular Obsidian note. It will fetch all of the headers which exist on that same page and display them in an unordered list at the top.

<br />

This version requires you to install the following:
- [Dataview Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

### Subfolder Data

<p align="center"><img style="width: 100%;text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aetherinox/obsidian-table-of-contents/main/Snippets/Subfolder%20Data/images/example_1.gif"></p>

The `Subfolder Data` snippet displays a table of contents listing based on a specified subfolder. This is useful if you want to pull a list of headers which exist on a page that is not associated to the current folder you are working in.

The other snippets above also support subpages, but this one is a bit more customized for subfolder management.

<br />

This version **requires** you to install the following:
- [Dataview Plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

The following plugins are **optional**:
- [Folder Notes Plugin](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes)

The `Table of Contents: Bad Links` snippet displays a list of internal links within your vault that lead nowhere (are broken).

To fix these, you can delete the link on the associated page, or you can click each item in the list and create a new page. Once the link has been fixed, it will be removed from the list.
